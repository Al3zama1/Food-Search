This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

OVERVIEW:

This project was created with React Js and Bootstrap. The Goal of the project was to build a website where recipies are displayed at launch. Clicking on the image of a recipe will take you to another page containing detailed information about the recipe. The recipes are obtained at lanch by calling an API(food2fork). Additionally, the website has a search bar where the user can make requests to the API with desired ingredients and the matching results will be displayed on the window.


THOUGHTS:

Working on this project helped me understand how lifesycle methods and also further helped me understand props, state, functional components and class components. Also, I learned to work under pressure because the API that i was using only allowed me to use it 50 times a day, so I had to think clearly about my code before I made a request to the API. Overall, I got exposure to how the react folder structure works and how react apps work in general.
