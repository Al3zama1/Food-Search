OVERVIEW:

This project was created with React Js and Bootstrap. The Goal of the project was to build a website where recipies are displayed at launch. Clicking on the image of a recipe will take you to another page containing detailed information about the recipe. The recipes are obtained at lanch by calling an API(food2fork). Additionally, the website has a search bar where the user can make requests to the API with desired ingredients and the matching results will be displayed on the window.
